# Music Recommendation System

## Designed & developed a Collaborative Filtering & Content Based Recommendation system to generate music recommendations for users using the Million Song Dataset.

###Collaborative Filtering(user-user and item-item) was implemented in Apache Spark, while Content Based Recommendation was implemented in Python.

*University policy prohibits me from sharing the code online. However, the report (outlining the design & methodology) is linked and code is available on request.*
